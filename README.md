## Hi there 👋, my name is Kyle Johnson
I'm a passionate **Software Developer** with a strong foundation in **C, C#, Java, and web development**. I enjoy creating intuitive user interfaces, tackling complex problems, and learning new technologies to continually sharpen my skills.  

My journey into software development began two years ago—and I haven’t looked back since. Whether it's building applications from the ground up or fine-tuning backend logic, I find joy in every step of the development process.

Before entering tech, I spent eight years in customer service and leadership roles. That experience shaped my adaptability, communication skills, and ability to perform under pressure—traits that now fuel my approach to software development.
